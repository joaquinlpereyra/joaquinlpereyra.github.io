About me
--------------

I learned to develop when I was a teenager and never stopped since then. Right now I'm working as a security engineer at Mercado Libre working mostly in an AST-based statyc analysis tool for Groovy, Javascript and Go code.

I love designing and implementing systems that make the life of other people easier. Every software should be as simple as posible for the end user, no matter how complicated it is on the inside.

I'm very interested in web security, functional programming, API and documentation design and Linux in general. I'm a terminal-lover and thrive on text-based interfaces.
