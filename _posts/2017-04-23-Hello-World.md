So, I'm back to blogging. Againg, again, again. But this time I intend to actually post from time to time. I think this
will be mostly about technical stuff, specially little useful code snippets and fun facts I find while messing around
with my programs or at work.

Introductions are not very fun, so I will end this here. But I want to try this code snippet thing Jekyll says it has,
so...


{% highlight python %}
def hello_world(name):
    """Prints "Hi World!" to STDOUT."""
    print("Hi World!")

hello_world('Tom')
{% endhighlight %}
